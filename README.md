# amiga-ptplayer-minimal
This is a  modified version of Frank Wille's ptplayer Amiga Protracker replay source with changes for small / 64KB demo productions to reduce the size of the code.

The original code is on Aminet: http://aminet.net/package/mus/play/ptplayer

The changes are:
* The Paula period table is generate in code rather than using a large table
*
